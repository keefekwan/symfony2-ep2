Starting in Symfony2 - Episode 2
================================

Well hallo there! Inside this archive, you'll find 3 things:

1) start - This is the start version of the code that's used in this screencast.
   NOTE: If you watched episode 1, this code is *slightly* different than
   the code you finished with at the end of that episode. Specifically:

   * Styling was added to the site
   * The stylesheets block was moved from layout.html.twig to base.html.twig
   * The "/event" route prefix was removed so that the event listing page
        is now the homepage.

2) finish - This is the finished version of the code that we build
   in this screencast. For more details on how to run the code,
   see the README.md file in that directory.

3) resources - This directory contains a few files that we will use
   while building our project. For more details, see the README.md
   file in that directory

And as always, thanks so much for your support and letting us do what
we love!
