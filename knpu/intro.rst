Introduction
============

Welcome to episode 2 of our "Starting in Symfony2" series. Last time we got
to know the framework, going through all of its most important parts, like
routing, controllers, templates, configuration and the basics of Doctrine.
Over the next hour, we're going to take you through some of the most difficult
areas of Symfony learning all about security, forms, and other things. Some
of these concepts will probably feel a bit new at first, but hopefully you'll
also see just how simple things can be. When you get to the end, you'll be
well on your way to mastering Symfony.

One of the things we'll be creating is a security system that stores users
in the database. This is functionality similar to what's offered by the very
popular `FOSUserBundle`_. That bundle is really great, but until you understand
how the security system works, you're going to run into limitations. Once
you do, you'll feel at home using `FOSUserBundle`_ or configuring the security
system all on your own.

Wait! Don't run off it's not all about security! We've got a lot of great
things to get through, so let's get started!
